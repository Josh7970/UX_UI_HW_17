        <p> My passion for creating intuitive and user-centered designs began while studying Information systems in college. 
            It was then that I discovered the similarities between design and analytics, and the
            importance of organization and visual appeal in creating a positive user experience. 
            However, it was while traveling across Southeast Asia that I truly understood the 
            correlation between design and the emotions it evokes. I saw firsthand how a person's
            experience can be greatly impacted by the interactions they have with their environment.
            This realization only solidified my belief that a good design should be meaningful, 
            purposeful, and memorable to truly benefit users. Without this understanding, design 
            is nothing more than a problem-creating tool. My goal as a designer is to create 
            experiences that not only look good, but also solve real problems for users
